This is a placeholder for a bug texture image.
In a real implementation, this would be an actual image file (PNG, JPG, etc.) 
that would be used as a texture for the bug models in the game.

For a complete implementation, you would need to:
1. Create or obtain actual texture images
2. Load them in the game.js file using THREE.TextureLoader
3. Apply them to the bug models
